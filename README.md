# Write a Data Science Blog Post

This repo consists of a notebook containing code for the first project of Semster 2 in the Udacity Data Science course.

This project is titled 'Write A Data Science Blog Post'.

The [Stack Overflow 2017 survey](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) data was used here in order to glean some information on professional developers and what to focus on to have the best career.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This project uses a Jupyter Notebook running Python 3 with the libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. These can be installed using pip but should be included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project was written as part of the Udacity Become a Data Scientist course. I used the Stack Overflow survey data due to my interest in professional software developers.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Project1.ipynb contains the Python code for this project.
It assumes that the survey data is in the same directory.
This can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017 .

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available in this link: https://medium.com/p/12d6fad79a7c/edit.

## Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>
Must acknowledge Stack Overflow and Kaggle for the data, whose licensing can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017). 
Guidance on implementing the notebook and README were taken from learnings in the Udacoty course. The sole author of the code was Tom Barrett.
